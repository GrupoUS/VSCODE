# GRUPO US VIBECODE SYSTEM V2.0 - RULE AUDIT & REFACTORING PRD

## Project Overview
Comprehensive audit and refactoring of all rules in @project-core/rules/ directory to ensure interconnectivity, eliminate orphan rules, optimize performance, and unify communication under a master rule system for maximum efficiency and reduced API requests.

## MACRO OBJECTIVES (Preferred)
1. Complete Rule System Refactoring
   - Rule dependency mapping + Orphan detection + Architecture optimization
   - Centralized master protocol implementation
   - Performance validation and documentation

## MICRO OBJECTIVES (Only when necessary)
1. Individual rule file corrections
2. Isolated dependency fixes
3. Specific integration validations

## Goals
- Audit all rules for connectivity and identify orphan rules
- Refactor rule structure for maximum performance and efficiency
- Unify all rules under centralized master execution protocol
- Reduce API requests and token usage through conditional loading
- Maintain centralized rule management in @project-core/ exclusively

## Features
- Rule Dependency Mapping: Create comprehensive dependency graph of all rules
- Orphan Rule Detection: Identify and integrate unused or disconnected rules
- Hierarchical Architecture: Implement conditional rule loading based on task context
- Performance Optimization: Reduce initial context load through smart rule organization
- Validation Framework: Ensure all changes maintain system integrity

## Technical Requirements
- All modifications must occur exclusively in @project-core/rules/ directory
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Implement conditional loading mechanism in 00-master-execution-protocol.md
- Update docs/architecture.md to reflect new structure
- Pass all integration tests (npm run integration:test)

## Success Criteria
- Zero orphan rules exist in the system
- All rules interconnected through single dependency graph
- Measurable reduction in token usage for standard tasks
- All quality metrics maintained (>85% completion rate, <50k tokens per feature)
- Complete documentation of new architecture

# ðŸš€ GRUPO US RULES SYSTEM - MASTER INDEX

## ðŸ“‹ OVERVIEW

Welcome to the centralized rules system for GRUPO US VIBECODE SYSTEM V2.0. This directory contains all consolidated rules, standards, and protocols for AI-assisted development across the entire ecosystem.

## ðŸŽ¯ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### **Single Source of Truth with Conditional Loading**

This `project-core/rules/` directory serves as the **canonical source** for all development rules, implementing intelligent conditional loading to optimize performance while ensuring consistency across all AI agents (Cline, Cursor, Roo Code).

### **Rule Orchestration Engine**

The system now implements a sophisticated rule loading algorithm that:

- **Always loads core rules**: Foundation principles and universal standards
- **Conditionally loads framework rules**: Based on task context detection
- **Dynamically loads MCP rules**: Based on complexity and task requirements
- **Eliminates orphan rules**: All rules are interconnected through dependency graph

### **Integration with Memory Bank**

- **Memory Bank**: Active learning system (`memory-bank/`) - preserved for continuous improvement
- **Project Core**: Centralized rules system (`project-core/rules/`) - this directory
- **Agent Configs**: Updated to reference centralized rules

## ðŸ“š RULES HIERARCHY & PRECEDENCE

### **ðŸš¨ PHASE 4 CENTRALIZED RULE ARCHITECTURE - ACTIVE**

**Status**: âœ… Phase 4 Implementation Complete
**Architecture**: Single Source of Truth with Universal Caller Rules
**Enforcement**: ALL rule modifications target @project-core/rules/ exclusively

### **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY EXECUTION ORDER**

#### **STEP 0: Workspace Verification (ABSOLUTE PRECEDENCE)**

```
universal-pre-execution-verification.md
```

**CRITICAL**: Must be executed BEFORE any other action - NO EXCEPTIONS

#### **STEP 1: Master Execution Protocol (CORE FOUNDATION)**

```
00-master-execution-protocol.md
```

**The 4-step execution cycle that governs ALL development activities**

#### **STEP 2: Universal Standards (APPLY TO ALL)**

```
01-core-principles.md          # Universal development principles
02-coding-standards-universal.md  # Universal coding standards
03-quality-assurance.md       # QA and testing standards
04-agent-coordination.md       # Multi-agent coordination

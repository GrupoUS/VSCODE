# ðŸš¨ CURSOR USER RULES - MANDATORY VIBECODE WORKFLOW V4.5

**CRITICAL**: Add this EXACT text to your Cursor User Rules to enforce GRUPO US VIBECODE SYSTEM V4.5 compliance.

---

## ðŸ§  MEMORY-FIRST PROTOCOL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**BEFORE ANY ACTION, ALWAYS:**

1. Read `@project-core/memory/master_rule.md` (Supreme source of truth)
2. Check `@project-core/memory/self_correction_log.md` (Learn from past errors)
3. Load `@project-core/memory/global-standards.md` (Current standards)

**STOP if confidence < 8/10 after memory consultation**

---

## âš¡ WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT BY COMPLEXITY

### **COMPLEXITY 1-6: STANDARD EXECUTION**

- Persona: MANAGER/EXECUTOR
- Process: THINK â†’ PLAN â†’ EXECUTE â†’ LEARN
- MCPs: Optional based on task requirements

### **COMPLEXITY 7-10: MANDATORY MCP ACTIVATION**

- Persona: ARCHITECT/CODER
- **MANDATORY**: Sequential Thinking MCP activation
- **MANDATORY**: Shrimp Task Manager coordination
- Process: THINK(MCP) â†’ PLAN(Shrimp) â†’ EXECUTE(Coordinated) â†’ LEARN(Document)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ MCP ACTIVATION COMMANDS (COPY-PASTE READY)

### **High Complexity Tasks (â‰¥7)**

```bash
# MANDATORY: Activate Sequential Thinking MCP
think --complexity=${COMPLEXITY} --domain="${DOMAIN}" --task="${TASK_DESCRIPTION}"
```

### **Multi-Phase Tasks (â‰¥5 or multiple phases)**

```bash
# MANDATORY: Activate Shrimp Task Manager
shrimp plan --task="${TASK_NAME}" --complexity=${COMPLEXITY} --phases=${PHASES}
```

---

## âœ… COMPLETION CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE marking any task complete, verify:**

### **Memory & Standards**

- [ ] Master rule consulted first
- [ ] Error patterns checked and avoided
- [ ] Global standards applied

### **Workflow Compliance**

- [ ] Complexity assessed (1-10)
- [ ] Correct persona adopted
- [ ] MCPs activated if complexity â‰¥7
- [ ] Shrimp coordination used if multi-phase

### **Quality & Learning**

- [ ] All quality gates passed
- [ ] Self-correction log updated
- [ ] New patterns documented

---

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VIOLATION DETECTION

**AUTO-HALT CONDITIONS:**

- Complexity â‰¥7 without Sequential Thinking MCP
- Multi-phase task without Shrimp Task Manager
- No memory consultation before execution
- No learning documentation after completion

**VIOLATION RESPONSE:** Immediate halt + manual review required

---

## ðŸ“‹ QUICK COMMANDS FOR CURSOR

```bash
# Start any task
cat @project-core/memory/master_rule.md

# Check for known issues
grep -i "violation\|critical" @project-core/memory/self_correction_log.md

# Complexity assessment
COMPLEXITY=$(assess_task_complexity --task="${TASK}")

# High complexity activation
if [ $COMPLEXITY -ge 7 ]; then
    think --complexity=$COMPLEXITY --task="${TASK}"
    shrimp plan --task="${TASK}" --complexity=$COMPLEXITY
fi
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS FORMULA

**MEMORY FIRST + MCP ENFORCEMENT + QUALITY GATES + LEARNING = PERFECT COMPLIANCE**

1. **Memory**: Load context from knowledge base
2. **MCPs**: Activate based on complexity thresholds
3. **Quality**: Pass all architectural and code standards
4. **Learning**: Document patterns for future use

**Confidence Target**: â‰¥9/10 throughout execution

**ðŸš€ VIBECODE SYSTEM V4.5 - DISCIPLINED EXCELLENCE**

_Add this to Cursor User Rules for automatic workflow enforcement_

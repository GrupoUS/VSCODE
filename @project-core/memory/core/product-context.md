```

### Memory Consultation Flow
1. **Pre-Execution Consultation** (Mandatory)
   - Load Memory Bank context
   - Check cache for similar solutions
   - Find pattern matches
   - Load relevant decisions
   - Generate consultation report

2. **Task Execution** (Guided)
   - Follow consultation recommendations
   - Use cached solutions when available
   - Apply learned patterns
   - Maintain execution context

3. **Post-Execution Update** (Automatic)
   - Extract learnings from execution
   - Update pattern library
   - Cache successful solutions
   - Update Memory Bank files
   - Trigger self-improvement

### Status Transparency System
Every AI response includes status prefix:
- **`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]`** - Memory Bank available and consulted
- **`[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]`** - Memory Bank not available
- **`[MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]`** - Memory Bank being updated (UMB mode)

## Integration Guidelines

### For Developers
1. **Always consult memory** before starting any task
2. **Follow consultation recommendations** from the memory system
3. **Update memory bank** after completing tasks
4. **Use cached solutions** when available to reduce API costs

### For AI Assistants
1. **Mandatory consultation** - Call memory consultation before any execution
2. **Status transparency** - Include appropriate status prefix in all responses
3. **Pattern application** - Apply learned patterns from memory bank
4. **Automatic updates** - Update memory bank after task completion

### For System Integration
1. **MCP compatibility** - Ensure all integrations follow MCP standards
2. **Cache optimization** - Implement intelligent caching for all API calls

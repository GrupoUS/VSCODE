# ðŸ§  OPTIMIZED MEMORY STRUCTURE - GRUPO US VIBECODE SYSTEM V3.1

## ðŸ“‹ CORE DEVELOPMENT PREFERENCES (CONSOLIDATED)

### **Development Environment Integration**
- User prefers unified development environment integration between Augment Code and Cursor AI with shared configuration files, consolidated coding standards, unified memory/knowledge bases, and seamless cross-platform functionality while preserving existing assets.
- User prefers code and instructions to be written as continuous text without code block separations to facilitate easier copying.

### **System Maintenance & Evolution**
- User prefers comprehensive system maintenance scripts that perform task-driven rule updates, project-core synchronization, legacy system cleanup, performance optimization, and system validation while preserving active configurations and maintaining zero downtime for the unified development environment.
- User prefers enhanced system evolution that automatically updates rules, workflows, configurations, and documentation based on successful execution patterns, with dry-run capability, comprehensive validation, and backward compatibility maintenance.

### **MCP Configuration & Workflow**
- User prefers centralized MCP configuration using @project-core/configs/mcp-master-unified.json as single source of truth, with elimination of duplicate/conflicting MCP config files to ensure unified system operation.
- User prefers Cursor AI to follow the GRUPO US VIBECODE SYSTEM V3.1 unified workflow with mandatory 4-step cycle (THINK â†’ PLAN â†’ EXECUTE â†’ LEARN), memory consultation from @project-core/memory/, Sequential Thinking MCP for complexity â‰¥7, MCP Shrimp Task Manager for coordination.

### **Specialization & Routing**
- Cursor AI specialization: Frontend & UI Development Specialist (complexity 1-6) with handoff to Augment Code for backend tasks (complexity 7-10).
- User prefers integration of think-mcp-server strategy with structured reasoning capabilities and Shrimp Task Manager workflow into project-core system, using complexity-based thinking hierarchy (thinking for 5-6, thinking_hard for 7-8, ultrathink for 9-10) and mandatory reflection steps after tool outputs for tasks with complexity >= 5.

### **Agent Orchestration & Memory System**
- User requires mandatory workflow for think-mcp-server integration: Sequential Thinking MCP for complexity â‰¥7, MCP Shrimp coordination, memory bank consultation, and hierarchical thinking strategy (thinkingâ†’thinking_hardâ†’ultrathink) based on task complexity levels.
- User requires mandatory workflow for agent orchestration improvements: THINK (Sequential Thinking for complexity â‰¥7) â†’ PLAN (MCP Shrimp Task Manager) â†’ EXECUTE (incremental with MCP Shrimp validation) â†’ LEARN (document in @project-core/memory/), with focus on preserving core functionality while optimizing performance and eliminating obsolete components.
- User wants to enhance existing agent routing system by studying Archon and PraisonAI architectures, improving memory integration and performance while cleaning up unused rules/workflows, without changing core system functionality.

### **Unified Memory System Configuration**
- User requires unified memory system using C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\workspaceStorage\f93728a73b8802154d6c1bd441b921c0\Augment.vscode-augment\Augment-Memories as single source of truth for both Augment Code and Cursor AI, with focus on objective, non-redundant memory content and performance optimization.

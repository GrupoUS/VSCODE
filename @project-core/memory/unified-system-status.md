- **Tools**: Chat mode, Next Edit, Instructions, Completions
- **MCP Priority**: Sequential Thinking, MCP Shrimp Task Manager, Supabase

### Cursor AI - Frontend & UI Specialist
- **Complexity Range**: 1-6 (Low to medium complexity tasks)
- **Primary Domains**: Frontend development, component creation, UI/UX improvements, styling
- **Tools**: Composer mode, Chat mode, real-time feedback
- **MCP Priority**: Playwright, Figma, MCP Shrimp Task Manager

## 🔄 UNIFIED EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### 1. Task Analysis & Environment Selection
```javascript
function selectEnvironment(taskComplexity, domain) {
  if (taskComplexity >= 7 || domain.includes(['backend', 'api', 'database', 'architecture'])) {
    return 'augment';
  }
  if (taskComplexity <= 6 || domain.includes(['frontend', 'ui', 'components', 'styling'])) {
    return 'cursor';
  }
  return 'augment'; // Default for complex tasks
}
```

### 2. Memory Consultation Protocol (Both Environments)
```bash
# MANDATORY before any task
cat @project-core/memory/master_rule.md
cat @project-core/memory/self_correction_log.md
cat @project-core/memory/global-standards.md
```

### 3. Cross-Environment Handoff System
- **Augment → Cursor**: Backend complete → Frontend development
- **Cursor → Augment**: UI complete → Backend optimization/integration

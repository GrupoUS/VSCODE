## ðŸš¨ ERRORS IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

### **Error 1: Sequential Thinking Connection Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Dual Sequential Thinking tools causing "Not connected" errors
- **Root Cause**: Tool conflicts in MCP configuration
- **Solution**: Single tool approach with sequentialthinking_Sequential_Thinking
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED

### **Error 2: Perplexity MCP Path Issues**
- **Issue**: Hardcoded path causing 401 errors
- **Root Cause**: Machine-specific absolute path
- **Solution**: Updated to npx -y @pashpashpash/perplexity-mcp
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED

### **Error 3: MCP Configuration Gaps**
- **Issue**: Working tools not in primary MCP configuration
- **Root Cause**: Tools available but not properly configured
- **Solution**: Added both tools to .vscode/mcp.json
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED

### **Error 4: Protocol Violations**
- **Issue**: Sequential Thinking not used for complexity â‰¥ 7 tasks
- **Root Cause**: No automatic enforcement mechanism
- **Solution**: Created enforcement protocol and updated guidelines
- **Status**: âœ… RESOLVED

## ðŸ“š LEARNING EXTRACTION AND CORRECT COMMANDS

### **Correct Commands Documented**:
```bash
# Sequential Thinking (CORRECT)
use_mcp_tool("sequentialthinking_Sequential_Thinking", {...})

# Perplexity MCP (CORRECT)

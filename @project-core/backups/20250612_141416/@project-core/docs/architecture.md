### 5. Quality Assurance (Integrated)

#### Metrics & KPIs
- **Completion Rate**: > 85% first attempt
- **Token Usage**: < 50k per feature
- **Error Rate**: < 15% in production
- **Confidence Level**: >= 8/10 before execution
- **Learning Integration**: 100% of insights captured

#### Code Quality
- **ESLint** + **Prettier** configuration
- **TypeScript strict mode**
- **Automated testing coverage**
- **Security scanning**
- **Memory-bank pattern validation**

## Workflow Architecture (Integrated)

### 1. Initialization Protocol
```bash
# Memory-bank MCP initialization
@file:memory-bank/protocols/mcp_initialization_protocol.md

# MCP Server Status Check
task-master status
npm run figma:test
npm run integration:test

# Task Management
task-master init --yes
task-master parse-prd project-core/tasks/prd.txt
task-master list
task-master next
```

### 2. Development Workflow (4-Step Cycle)
1. **THINK**: Load memory-bank master rule + project-core context
2. **PLAN**: Create detailed execution plan with both systems
3. **EXECUTE**: Implement using integrated standards
4. **LEARN**: Update memory-bank with new insights

### 3. Agent Coordination (Enhanced)
- **Memory-bank protocols**: Core execution and learning
- **Project-core coordination**: Architecture and task management
- **Git synchronization**: Commits as coordination points
- **Learning integration**: Continuous improvement

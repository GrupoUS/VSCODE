# TASK MASTER PERFORMANCE RULES

## CONSOLIDATION MANDATORY
- NEVER create micro-tasks for related operations
- ALWAYS group related changes in single task
- ALWAYS implement complete workflows

## API OPTIMIZATION REQUIRED
- MAXIMIZE context usage per request
- MINIMIZE intermediate validations
- BATCH process related operations

## PERFORMANCE METRICS
- Target: < 5 API calls per major feature
- Target: < 3 tasks per feature implementation
- Target: 60%+ cost reduction vs. micro-tasks
